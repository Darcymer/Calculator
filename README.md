# Overview

As a Software Engineering, my goal is to understand various languages, method, and other uses in the field for my skills. I am able to grow, learn, and fully understand the various needs that a software developer can provide to a team. My skills utilized to understand and adapt as a coder and as a software developer to be able to better help my team and to be useful in any projects that I work on.

The software that I wrote is a pretty simple calculator, it utilizes the four basic operators of math, a modulus, returns the sum, and exit the program. In the very beginning of the program the user implements their name.

The purpose of this code is to help me understand how Java syntax, methods and other uses work. This is my first time working in the language, so I wish to know and understand how the language works.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
The Developers tools that I use were via studios, and that Java download website.

I also utilize GitHub to be able to have a repository for my code that you're currently seeing right now.


The programming language that I use is ofcourse java. So admittedly some c++ knowledge help me understand how to manipulate other Java files to read one another particularly in classes.
